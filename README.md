## Overview

-I made this webpage using multiple flexboxes for different sections to make sure the elements in the page could change and display in a certain way when screen dimensions were altered. As the viewing screen gets narrower, the elements in the page switch from a wider row layout to a column layout. 
-Navigation links were added to the header for easier traversal through the page. When a user clicks on the links, they will be sent to the section of the page corresponding to the link. There is also contact information at the bottom of the page that, if hyperlinked, will send the user to an external page when clicked. 
-A picture was added and placed in the header of the page. 
-In the work section, there are 5 boxes that will display future webpages/applications. The first box is enlarged to show the most prestiged project worked on. Only one project is displayed as of now and it can be navigated to by clicking anywhere on the box. There is a background image and a label that gives the user a quick glimpse of what to expect if they click on the box.
-CSS selectors have comments to give the user a quick explanation of what each selector does to the sheet.
